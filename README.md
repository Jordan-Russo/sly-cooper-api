The SlyCooper API is a powerful tool that allows developers to access and utilize data related to the popular video game franchise, Sly Cooper. 
This API provides a wide range of functionalities to retrieve information about characters. 
With the SlyCooper API, developers can build applications and websites that enhance and roleplay the Sly Cooper experience.

## How It's Made:

I have developed a new found appreciation for Express. It is a very efficient tool when paired with Node.js for quickly deploying a flexible and lightweight API for handling requests.

## Optimizations/Refactoring
When I improve the design of the API, I will implement API caching to boost performance with faster response times, reduced server load and costs.
Currently, the API only includes characters from the first game in the series: "Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus". Plans are being made to incorporate the rest of them as well.

## Learned Lessons:
<p>One of the biggest lessons I have learned throughout making the Sly Cooper API besides that I find it very nostalgic is that developing an API isn't nearly as challenging as I thought it would be.</p>
<p>This is most certainly due to the ease with Cylic hosting paired with the HTTPS utility and middleware that Express provides within the Node.js environment. This allows me to spend most of my time the important tasks, like filtering the JSON based on client query parameters in a variety of methods.</p>
<p>The importance of CORS, and how to use it along with understanding how servers listen to requests and port availability, were notable and make me much more capable of resolving common bugs to create a product enjoyed by every Sly fan worldwide.</p>
